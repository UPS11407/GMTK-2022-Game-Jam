# Dicey Heights!
 This is my submission for the [GMTK 2022 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022). It is a 2D platformer where the player collects coins to open a door and ascend a small tower to the finish flag.\
 It was created using the Unity game engine during the 48 hour period with the theme of "Roll of the Dice".\
 You can view this game on Itch.io [Here!](https://ups407.itch.io/dicey-heights)
